## About this site

This site is my personal knowledge book for working with Nibiru Chain. You should read the [official docs](https://nibiru.fi/docs) also. You may ask why I made a separate site when the official docs already exist? There are a couple of reasons:

1. The official docs is targeted at a broader audience, such as web3 beginners, investors, developers, blockchain users, and infra operators/validators. This site is focused primarily on developers.
2. This site allows me to iterate quickly without having to worry about SEO or branding. That being said, all content on this site is completely independent and not representative of the Nibiru Chain foundation.

## Navigating the site

The site's structure is based off [Divio's "four types of documentation"](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/):&#x20;

* tutorials
* how-to guides
* technical reference
* explanation

Each type of documentation has its own section in the navigation.&#x20;



**Tutorials** are zero-to-hero follow along guides that assume zero prior knowledge

**How-to guides** are quick and easy scripts and steps that accomplish one specific thing.

**References** are full specifications of a specific sub-system.

**Explanations** are written to develop a conceptual understanding.
